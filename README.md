# H&R 2020 - VR Robot Explorer
 **[Our Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/hnr2020-vr-robot)**

This is basically a robot which is controlled by VR. The robot has two cameras and some sensors which are used to give users data about the environment the robot is in. Input from the camera and sensors is displayed on the VR headset. The clients can rotate their headset, which will cause the robot's camera to rotate in the same direction, and by touching the side button of the headset, the robot will start or stop moving.

The project consists of 4 main modules: The client, server, Raspberry Pi and Arduino. All 4 modules communicate with each other either directly or through another module to ensure that the robot functions as expected.

## Module list
 - [Client Module](https://github.com/team-unununium/HnR-2020-VR-Client)
 - [Server Module](https://github.com/team-unununium/HnR-2020-VR-Server)
 - [Raspberry Pi Module](https://github.com/team-unununium/HnR-2020-VR-Pi)
 - [Arduino Module](https://github.com/team-unununium/HnR-2020-VR-Arduino)

# Current module - Arduino
The Arduino module records the environment data of the robot such as its surrounding temperature, humidity and proximity to surrounding areas and sends it back to the Raspberry Pi once one of the modules detect a significant change in any of the recorded values.

## How to install
Simply copy the .ino file to your Arduino and you would be good to go! To integrate this with the other modules, connect the Arduino to a USB port on the Raspberry Pi. You may need certain sensors such as temperature and humidity sensors for it to work.
